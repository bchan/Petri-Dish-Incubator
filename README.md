# Petri Dish Incubator
This Arduino code was created for an assignment to build a petri dish incubator for EK210 Introduction to Engineering Design at BU. Essentially, it regulates the temperature from a humidity sensor and cycles the heating element on and off. Intially, the air is heated up to a certain temperature, via the water bath, and then the heating element is cycled so that it heats for 4 seconds and cools for 6 seconds. If the temperature drops below a certain temperature, the heat cycling starts again.
